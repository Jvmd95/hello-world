# IMDB Data analysis

A data analysis project using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. 

In this analysis I will focus only on movies, and on quantifiable information like ratings and year that can be analysed by data. Some questions that I am interested about are: What is the average rating per movie genre? and per decade?


## What is IMDB?

IMDB is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games and so on. The database stores information such as: cast, production crew, personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, fan and critical reviews, movie genres and ratings.


## Data sources

The data comes from the official IMDB datasets they offer for non-commercial use. You can find it on this link: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
