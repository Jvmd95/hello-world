# IMDB Data analysis

A data analysis project using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. I focus on movies on this project while ignoring TV shows and other type of media. 

## Data sources

The data comes from the official IMDB datasets they offer for non-commercial use. You can find it on this link: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
