# imdb_analysis

A simple data analysis project using only pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. The data comes from the official IMDB datasets they offer for non-commercial use. You can find an explanation for the dataset on this link: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/

Luckily the database was mostly clean so almost no data cleaning was done.

In the future I will add an analysis of TV shows.
